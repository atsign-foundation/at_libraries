# at_libraries

Welcome to at_libraries. This project is open with intentâ€”we encourage
contributions, and we want pull requests to hear about issues.


## What is this for?

This repository contains three atPlatform libraries for developers building
their own atPlatform applications. (These libraries can also be found on
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages))

[at_contact](https://pub.dev/packages/at_contact): A contacts library that
persists across different @ Platform applications. You can see this dependency
in action by cloning the at_chat_flutter project from the
[at_widgets repository](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets).

[at_lookup](https://pub.dev/packages/at_lookup): A low-level library that
directly implements the atProtocol verbs. You can find this dependency in
several other packages such as at_client and at_client_mobile.

[at_onboarding_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/at_onboarding_cli): A command
line library to authenticate and onboard Atsigns intended for use in
headless applications such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

[at_server_status](https://pub.dev/packages/at_server_status): A helpful
library that logs the status of the root server as well as a secondary
server of your choice.

[at_cli_commons](https://pub.dev/packages/at_cli_commons): A library of
generic / reusable stuff which is useful when building cli programs which
use the [AtClient SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/at_client)
