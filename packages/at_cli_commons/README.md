## Summary

A library of generic / reusable stuff which is useful when building cli programs
which use the [AtClient SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/at_client)

For usage example, see the demo software [here](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_lorawan)

## Features

- The CLIBase class in cli_base.dart takes care of all the boilerplate
  involved in getting from program startup to having an AtClient object you can
  use - parsing command-line arguments, standard configuration, loading
  authentication keys, etc.
- There are a few other small utilities in utils.dart which CLIBase uses
